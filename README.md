## Feature: A web3-enabled Scantron testing system for desktop, mobile, and tablet
This system revolutionizes traditional paper-based testing by incorporating blockchain technology to ensure test integrity, security, and verifiability. By enabling web3 features, the system facilitates secure, immutable record-keeping for each test taken, providing a tamper-evident solution that addresses problems associated with paper tests, such as fraud, loss, and damage. The system is designed to operate seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and tablet platforms, ensuring flexible and accessible test-taking. It provides benefits such as decentralized data storage, enhanced privacy through cryptography, and the possibility for automated smart contract-based scoring. Students can receive instant, indisputable results, and educators can analyze data with confidence. The web3-enabled Scantron testing system represents a significant step towards the future of educational assessments.
