## Feature: Zero-Knowledge Proof Based Verification for Bug Bounties
This method employs zero-knowledge proofs to allow white hat hackers to demonstrate the discovery of a security vulnerability without revealing the exploit details. Utilizing cryptographic techniques, the hacker creates a proof that validates they have found a bug which satisfies certain known parameters of the system being tested. The zero-knowledge proof assures that no proprietary or sensitive information is disclosed in the process, safeguarding both the hacker's unique finding and the company's software integrity. Problem it solves: enables secure, trust-minimized verification of bug discovery, maintaining confidentiality and preventing premature exposure of the exploit. Benefits include protecting the intellectual property of the reporting hacker, ensuring they are the sole party able to leverage the discovery for compensation, and promoting a safe platform for companies to engage with external security researchers, thereby incentivizing and advancing the cybersecurity industry.
