## Feature: A web3-enabled Scantron testing system for desktop, mobile, and tablet
This system revolutionizes traditional paper-based testing by incorporating blockchain technology to ensure test integrity, security, and verifiability. By enabling web3 features, the system facilitates secure, immutable record-keeping for each test taken, providing a tamper-evident solution that addresses problems associated with paper tests, such as fraud, loss, and damage. The system is designed to operate seamlessly across desktop, mobile, and tablet platforms, ensuring flexible and accessible test-taking. It provides benefits such as decentralized data storage, enhanced privacy through cryptography, and the possibility for automated smart contract-based scoring. Students can receive instant, indisputable results, and educators can analyze data with confidence. The web3-enabled Scantron testing system represents a significant step towards the future of educational assessments.

## Feature: Personal Tax Distribution and Advocacy Microsite
This microsite empowers users by providing personalized insights into their tax contributions and allowing for proactive civic engagement. Upon entering their annual income and location, the platform calculates the individual's contributions to city, state, and federal taxes. A visual breakdown displays the distribution of these taxes in accordance with actual public budgets, expressed in percentages. The innovative feature of this microsite is the interactive budget reallocation tool that invites users to realign their tax contributions to preferred governmental functions. It encourages informed decision-making by highlighting the disparity between actual and user-preferred budget allocations. Following adjustments, users can directly email their representatives with a structured message advocating for the reappropriation of public funds. This feature not only enhances transparency and awareness regarding public spending but also equips citizens to voice their priorities, bridging the gap between taxpayers and legislative authorities for a more representative democracy.
